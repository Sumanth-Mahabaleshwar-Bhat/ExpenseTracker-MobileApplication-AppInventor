# App Inventor Final Project
For the final AI project, you will create a custom app. It is an individual project. Your app should be web-enabled either by having some user-generated, persistent data that is shared on the web (using TinyWebDB) or by using fake data through Mockaroo or using real
database store such as Firebase. The application must satisfy the following programming specs:
1. Multiple screens (at least 3)
2. Custom defined Procedures (at least 3)
3. Control flow structures (conditions and/or loops) (at least 3)
4. Variables (at least 3)
5. Lists (at least 1)
6. Data persistence
7. Use of sensors (at least 1)
  
It should also satisfy one or more of the following requirements:
1. App is web-enabled using an existing API or Mockaroo
2. App saves user-generated data using TinyWebDB or Firebase
3. Add user signup/login using Firebase (should be integral to the app functionality)
